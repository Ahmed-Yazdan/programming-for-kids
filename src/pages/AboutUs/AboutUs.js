            <p>This organization is founded by <span className="text-purple-500">Ahmed Yazdan</span>, A student of class 10 at Ideal School and College with a view to help those kids out there who are willing to start learning programming. I have seen so many kids who are interested in programming. But it's a matter of sorrow that their will of leaning fades away as they can't find any good resources to start leaning. That's where out organization come. We are giving best programming courses designed for kids so that they can follow their dreams!</p>
